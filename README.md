In this activity, you will use a loop to iterate through a sentence and count the number of words. For this implementation, we aren't going to worry about too many complexities and will just consider words to be split by a single space.

Follow the instructions in the comments. After you've come up with a solution, check the provided solution in the spoilers branch.
